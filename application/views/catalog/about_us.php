											<p>

											PrêtàStyler eliminates the hassle and uncertainity of shopping online for fashion

											by creating a unique fashion feed for every member based on their physical

											profile and personal preferences.</p><p>

											As a member, everyday new items that are perfect for you will be added to your

											personal mall from brands across the globe and you'll get expert style advice on

											how to wear garments and pull outfits together. The smarts behind the platform

											to make all this possible is simply referred to as the ‘magic’ and it’s the search

											technology that’s going to change your life. What Google is for internet searches,

											PrêtàStyler is for clothing searches. We call it Cloogle. And we think you’re going

											to love it.</p><p>

											Ann Reinten is the co-founder of PrêtàStyler and she comes with sterling style

											credentials. In 1996 she launched The Australian Image Company which in 2009

											became Image Innovators. Ann has travelled the globe training image

											consultants on almost every continent and has created internationally, award

											winning online style programs (My Private Stylist and Men of Style) which have

											helped tens of thousands of men and women. That’s a lot of style experience.

											The idea for PrêtàStyler was bounced around back in the 90’s but the idea and

											vision was bigger than the technology. Do you remember the size of mobile

											phones back then? Now that the technology has caught up PretaStyler has been

											created and we think you'll love it!</p><p>

											By combining technological magic with style know-how PrêtàStyler has

											reshaped the online shopping experience. Thank you for being a part of our

											story, as together we make PrêtàStyler the biggest and best personalized

											Shopping Mall in the world
