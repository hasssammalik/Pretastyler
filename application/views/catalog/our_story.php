										After hours of searching, you finally spot just the thing for that special occasion. You order your usual size, excitedly await delivery…and then experience that familiar sense of dejection when it looks nothing like it did online. You package it up to return, paying again for postage and going back to square one in your quest for the perfect outfit. Surely someone can take the hard work out of online shopping?
										</p>
										<p>
										Like millions of men and women around the world, Image Consultant Ann Reinten recognises online shopping as a saving grace in our busy lives; no jostling for parking, no stuffy changing rooms and no dragging tired kids around endless stores. “I have loved and hated the web in equal parts; I love it for its wealth of options no matter what your size, shape or age, and hate how difficult it can be to find what you are looking for. There just had to be a better solution” said Ann, speaking of her own love/hate battle with online shopping. And so, from a combination of determination and a wealth of styling experience, PrêtàStyler was born. Here is our story.

    								<div class="body">
    									
    									<p>The Prêt-à-Styler concept was conceived in the mid-eighties; a time when our founder Ann Reinten was putting her image training to great use, offering style and colour seminars and image consultancy services to men and women across Australia. Wearing a size 12-14 (Aus.) and the proud owner of what she affectionately describes as ‘generous’ thighs, Ann considered herself the average woman and this placed her in perfect stead to offer honest and well-informed style advice to her clients. </p>
    									<p>Ann’s image styling career continued to flourish and by the mid-nineties she was imparting her vast knowledge to an ever wider audience, thanks to styling features for magazines including Australian Stitches and The Women’s Weekly. As technology progressed, Ann and her engineer husband Ron developed their first metric computer style program and personal colour solutions programs, and in 1996 Ann founded The Australian Image Company, renaming as Image Innovators in more recent years and continuing to enjoy phenomenal success around the globe to this day; over 500 image consultants now use Image Innovators’ products internationally.</p>
    									<p>This wealth of experience would form the seed for what would eventually become known as PrêtàStyler.</p>

									<div class="body">										
										<p>The launch of PrêtàStyler is the culmination of years of experience, research and hard work. A giant leap for online shopping, the innovative website will transform the way you shop for clothes; </p>
										<p>Your personalized mall is filled with local and international brands – some familiar, others future favourites – all of them wonderfully flattering. Styles and sizes are selected just for you, based purely on your Body Profile and preferences. We’ll show you why each style works so well for your body shape and how to accessorize your outfit perfectly. The lessons you learn online will be with you every time you shop, as you gain confidence and get to know how flatter your assets and disguise your flaws. Our Genie Wizard even allows you to take any item from any website on the internet and check it against your Body Profile on PrêtàStyler, to see whether it is the style for you. “I created PrêtàStyler to take the fear, frustration and confusion out of online shopping. Now you can find what you want and what suits you in one perfect place” says proud founder Ann.</p>
										<p>With plans for one-to-one stylist and image consultancy services through the website, and the introduction of ‘Styling Boards’ on which to gather outfit inspiration and wish lists, along with the backing of esteemed fashion maven Henry Roth, the future is bright for PrêtàStyler.</p>
