				<div class="body">
					<p>You can stop trawling through a million sites looking for clothes that suit you.
					The future of shopping has arrived.
					You no longer have to suffer the frustration of falling into internet rabbit holes and surfacing two hours later with
					100 browser tabs open, no purchases made, and the one item you adored has mysteriously vanished. UGH! 
					It’s ok. You don’t need to shop like that anymore.
					Your favorite sites are now in one easy-to-use and easy-to-save place.<br>
					PretaStyler has heard your cries echoing out across the web:<br>
					~ What suits me?<br>
					~ Where can I buy it?<br>
					~ How do I style an outfit around my new purchase? <br>
					Well, prepare yourself. This is a life changing, shopping habit and wardrobe changing experience. It’s shopping, but not as you’ve known it.
					“So how does it work then?” Well, the site is packed with a bunch of technology smarts that we simply refer to as the “magic.”

				<div class="body">
					<p>Let the site do all your legwork to find you the exact item you’re looking for.
					With PretaStyler’s Targeted Search engine you can get super specific to find the exact clothing you want. Say you’re after a yellow, semi- fitted dress with a deep-scooped neckline, flutter sleeves, a waistline seam and a midi length. Just enter your search terms, cross your fingers and if it’s in the mall we’ll display it in a flash. Oh, you only want the dresses from ASOS? No problem. Consider it done. <br><br>
					Think of it like Google for clothes. We like to call it Cloogle.
